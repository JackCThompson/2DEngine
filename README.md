# Senior-Capstone-Project

This is the Capstone project for my senior year in high school. I decided to create a game that is essentially a tour of my high school featuring a few of the teachers and administrators in their respective rooms. I was a bit pressed for time and the end of senior year is  a busy time or else I would have loved to go into far more detail.
This was a very fun project!

Note: I am self taught and have no proffessional/conventional coding experience forgive me for any poor style!
