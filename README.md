# Senior-Capstone-Project

This is the Capstone project for my senior year in high school. I decided to create a game that is essentially a tour of my high school feauring a few of the teachers and administrators in their respective rooms. I was a bit strapped for time and the end of senior year is  a busy time or else I would have loved to go into far more detail.
This was a very fun project!
